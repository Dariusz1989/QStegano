# QStegano
Qt based Steganography application

## What is steganography? 
Steganography is the art of hiding the act of communitacion between two parties.

In digital world it comes to embedding some data inside media such as images, 
audio files or even network datagrams and then sending the prepared carrier.

## What can you find here?

In this project I would like to share my steganographic application. It deals with images and is able to hide text data inside them.

The core application is written in C++. For manipulating with images, I chose CImg library - fast and lightweight alternative to OpenCV.
Application has different interfaces. The main one is the command line interface that supports all of the available features.
On the other hand, one can use simple web interface written in Python & JavaScript with limited functionality.

## Instalation & configuration
